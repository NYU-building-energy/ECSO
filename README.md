### The Energy Cost Savings Predictor

ECSO is a tool to predict the potential cost and energy savings achieved by retrofitting government buildings.

The idea is to help the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) prioritize
its building energy retrofits to target those buildings that have the highest potential
for cost and energy savings.
